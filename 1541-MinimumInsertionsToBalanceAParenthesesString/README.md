# 1541. Minimum Insertions to Balance a Parentheses String

**Difficulty:** Medium  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-insertions-to-balance-a-parentheses-string/)

---

You are given a parentheses string `s` containing only the characters `'('` and `')'`. A parentheses string is **balanced** if it can be formed using the following rules:

- The empty string is balanced.
- If `A` is balanced, then `'('` + `A` + `'))'` is balanced.
- If `A` and `B` are balanced, then their concatenation is balanced.

In other words, every left parenthesis `'('` must have a corresponding pair of two consecutive right parentheses `'))'` that comes after it, and every right parenthesis must belong to exactly one such matching pair.

For example, `"())"`, `"())(())))"` and `"(())())))"` are balanced, while `")()"`, `"()))"` and `"(()))"` are not balanced.

You can insert the characters `'('` and `')'` at any position of the string to balance it if needed.

Return the **minimum** number of insertions needed to make `s` balanced.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "(()))"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:**

The second `'('` is matched with two consecutive `')'`, but the first `'('` has only one matching `')'`. We need to insert one more `')'` at the end to make the string `"(())))"`, which is balanced.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "())"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

The string is already balanced because its `'('` is followed by two consecutive `')'`, and both right parentheses belong to that matching pair.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "))())("

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

Insert `'('` at the beginning to match the first `'))'`, and insert `'))'` at the end to match the last `'('`. Three insertions are needed in total.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of `'('` and `')'` only.
