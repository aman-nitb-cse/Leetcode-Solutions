# 3938. Maximum Path Intersection Sum in a Grid

**Difficulty:** Medium  
[View on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-path-intersection-sum-in-a-grid/)

---

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`.

Two players move across the grid:

- Player 1 starts at the top-left cell `(0, 0)` and can move only right or down. Their destination is the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)`.
- Player 2 starts at the bottom-left cell `(m - 1, 0)` and can move only right or up. Their destination is the top-right cell `(0, n - 1)`.

Each player must choose a valid path from their respective starting cell to their destination.

A cell is called **shared** if it belongs to **both** chosen paths.

Return an integer denoting the **maximum** possible sum of values of all **shared** cells.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,2,0,-3],[1,-2,1,0],[-4,2,-1,3],[3,-3,3,-2],[-1,-5,0,1]]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**

The diagram shows one optimal choice of paths.

- Player 1 follows the red/purple path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell:

- `(0, 0) &rarr; (1, 0) &rarr; (2, 0) &rarr; (2, 1) &rarr; (2, 2) &rarr; (2, 3) &rarr; (3, 3) &rarr; (4, 3)`

- Player 2 follows the blue/purple path from the bottom-left cell to the top-right cell: - `(4, 0) &rarr; (4, 1) &rarr; (3, 1) &rarr; (2, 1) &rarr; (2, 2) &rarr; (2, 3) &rarr; (1, 3) &rarr; (0, 3)`

- The shared cells are `(2, 1)`, `(2, 2)`, and `(2, 3)`.

- The sum is `2 + (-1) + 3 = 4`, which is the maximum possible sum.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [[4,-2,-3],[-1,-3,-1],[-4,2,-1]]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:**

One optimal pair of paths is shown in the diagram.

- Player 1 follows the red/purple path:

- `(0, 0) &rarr; (1, 0) &rarr; (1, 1) &rarr; (1, 2) &rarr; (2, 2)`

- Player 2 follows the blue/purple path: - `(2, 0) &rarr; (1, 0) &rarr; (0, 0) &rarr; (0, 1) &rarr; (0, 2)`

- The shared cells are `(0, 0)` and `(1, 0)`.

- The sum is `4 + (-1) = 3`, which is the maximum possible.

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `2 <= m, n <= 1000`
- `4 <= m * n <= 5 * 10^5`
- `-100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`
